# Block Diagram: 2 hours
Notes: Make sure we completely understand the workflow of the CPU before we start building

# Verilog implementation of submodules and individual testing: 4 hours
Notes: Most of these submodules are already written (like the ALU, MUX, Register File, etc)

# Integrating components: 30 minutes
Notes: Should go quickly because all the submodules should be working

# Test bench and debugging: 3 hours

# Assembly test script: 2 hours
Notes: Most of this work should be able to be completed in class on Tuesday 10/23

# Report: 3 hours
Notes: Will be written and updated over the course of the lab
