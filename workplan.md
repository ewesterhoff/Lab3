# Work Plan: Lab3
March Saper and Emma Westerhoff

## Block Diagram: 2 hours
Notes: Make sure we completely understand the workflow of the CPU before we start building. This is based on our experience with the second lab. In Emma's experience, extensive planning of the FSM allowed for simple implementation. In March's experience, poor planning leads to an implementation nightmare.

## Verilog implementation of submodules and individual testing: 4 hours
Notes: Most of these submodules are already written (like the ALU, MUX, Register File, etc). Good unit testing at this part of the lab will prevent us from having to dig back into this layer later.

## Integrating components: 30 minutes
Notes: Should go quickly because all the submodules should be working. Similar to lab 2, most of the integration work was not building/integrating but rather testing.

## Test bench and debugging: 3 hours
Notes: Previous labs didn't leave enough time for this.

## Assembly test script: 2 hours
Notes: Most of this work should be able to be completed in class on Tuesday 10/23

## Report: 3 hours
Notes: Will be written and updated over the course of the lab. We've found that it's easier to keep track of our progress this way.
