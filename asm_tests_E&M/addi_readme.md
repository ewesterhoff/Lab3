##Add Immediate Assembly Script

Tests addi, beq, and jump

Purpose: Loads immediates into registers 8 and 9, tests for equality. If they are equal, program ends. If they are not, register 9 will increment by one until they are equal, or increase forever. There are no memory requirements, this program only deals with the register file.
